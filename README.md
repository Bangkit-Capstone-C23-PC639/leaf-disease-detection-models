# Rice Leaf Disease Classification Model

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model developed to classify rice leaf diseases. The model has been trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of 2,627 images representing six different rice leaf diseases, along with a category for healthy rice leaves. The trained model can be used to classify new rice leaf images and identify the presence of diseases.

## Dataset Description

The rice leaf disease dataset includes the following diseases and categories:

- Bacterial Leaf Blight
- Brown Spot
- Healthy
- Leaf Blast
- Leaf Scald
- Narrow Brown Spot

The dataset contains images in JPEG format (.jpg) and has been used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
